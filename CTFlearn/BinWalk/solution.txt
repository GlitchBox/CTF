The key was to use binwalk in an efficient manner. All this time I was trying to extract the file with -e flag. With this flag on, binwalk only extracts known 
file types. Every time I ran binwalk with -e flag on, it would spit out an impenetrable zlib file. binwalk couldn't crack open the zlib file. The extraction process would go on and on, ceaselessly. 

As it turns out, all I had to do is run a command which extracts a specific file type. The image had to images inside it. The second image contained the flag. I found out about the following command when I ran the man command for binwalk.

 "-D, --dd=<type:ext:cmd>
              Extract <type> signatures, give the files an extension of <ext>, and execute <cmd>"

  Therefore, the final command I had to run to extract the png file was: 'binwalk -D "png image:png" PurpleThing.jpeg'
