Go to the wikipedia and look up the mentioned ip address.
It's a user's contribution page. A user contribution page in the wikipedia lists the changes or contributions made by a user, ergo an IP user.
So the page I am looking at, is the contribution list for the ip user(128.125.52.138). They contributed a line to the article called "Flag" in the wikipedia.
Look at the "diff" tab. "diff" denotes to the differences between revisions made to "Flag" article. You can see the changes made by 128.125.52.138.
They added a flag. Which is the flag I was looking for.
