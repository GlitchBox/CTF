Okay.. so this problem wasn't in the forensics genre. It was labeled as binary. Honest to God, I was not entirely sure what that meant. The problem setter asked us to pwn a certain server. So, I immediately knew I was out of depth here. 

I established a connection with the server and started playing. During my first attempt, I bet 0 dollars; just to see how things went. I was wondering if I was supposed to use some command of the "nc" tool to unravel anything. Maybe I was supposed to use another tool? Perhaps leverage SQL injection. I thought I was supposed to enter something clever while I was guessing the number. Admittedly, my head was blank and I did not know how to proceed. I could not come up with any magic script and I was mostly losing. I decided to notice if there was any pattern to how the computer generated the random number. During one of attempts I bet 2 dollars and I lost. I had 498 left. 

I started going through the comments. SOmeone said I should try negative numbers. Unusual suggestion hmm.. What did the person mean? For the first time I started paying attention to how a player wins or loses money. I remembered I lost 2 dollars once. My bet was 2 dollars. Luckily I won once. I won 20 dollars and my bet was the same amount. Now I had 520 dollars. It immediately hit me. If I bet negative amount and lose on purpose I will be essentially winning any arbitrary amount. If I bet -100 dollars and lose; I will gain 100 dollars, how? 500 - (-100) = 600. In an attempt to take -100 dollars from me, they would end up giving me 100 dollars. So I bet -1000001 (the problem setter thought I would never get MORE than 10^6) and lost on purpose. Viola! I found the flag.

Teaches you sth about coding and testing. Always test your corner cases. Try ranges of values where your program isn't allowed to compute.
