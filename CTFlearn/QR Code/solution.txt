1) scan the qr code and extract the text
2) The extracted output "c3ludCB2ZiA6IGEwX29icWxfczBldHJnX2RlX3BicXI=" still looks gibberish
3) some kind of cipher or encoding has been applied to it
4) think of the ciphers that may have been applied. XOR cipher could have been applied. Try brute XOR.
5) Doesn't work
6) Notice that the string ends in "=". Remember that "=" is used as a padding character in base64. Also the length of the text is a multiple of 4. You have a lead. Also use this website to figure out the possible encoding https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier

7) Decode using base64. You have found "synt vf : a0_obql_s0etrg_de_pbqr"
8) This seems to appear like a legit english sentence. 
9) Try ceaser / rotation cipers with several rotation lengths. 
10) 13 works
11) Solution - QR code scan - decode base64 - caesar cipher (Rot13)
14) Cyberchef has been heavily used for this problem
